#### Grading

There will not be any exams in this course.
Your grade will be based on homework assignments. 

Instructions for homework:
* Each homework sheet is due before start of next week's class. 
* Work in your own fork of the course repository.
* To avoid merge conflicts, it is recommended to first copy the file and name it "HW1_your_name.lean"
* Work on the problems: usually the goal is to eliminate all `sorry`s.
* You should complete at least all problems marked as mandatory, others are optional.
* To submit your homework, commit&push your changes to your fork of this repository. 
* I'll only grade after the due date passed, so don't worry about committing partial progress.
